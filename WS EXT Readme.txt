These STL parts were designed to be printed on a Markforged Onyx desktop using Onyx material.
Onyx material on Bambu Labs X1C works well too.

You need USB port pins.  I buy these from Digikey.com and remove them from the part.

Pins are soldered to a support PCB for easier repeatability.  PCB gerbers included with the
3D models.  The required PCB needs to be 0.5mm thickness to fit the 3D models.

You need an assembly jig to help make the pin soldering to the PCB repeatable.
Works quite well.

Designed to be used with Amazon RS232 cable from C2G.  Part number 52034.

If you want to build a Wonderswan USB cable then use a FTDI USB 3.3V TTL cable from Amazon.com.
